These are  my thoughts on how to be a better developer improving performance in your daily and sometimes trivial activities.

### Configure prompt with git information

Put git information in your prompt (i.e.: branch and status) is a great way to get these without execute commands. There are many examples about how to do that, so that is a link with one of them [Git Prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt)

### Auto-correct

Enable auto-correct and suggested commands will run after 2 seconds.

before:

```bash
git statsh pop

git: 'statsh' is not a git command . See 'git --help'.

the most similar command is
    stash
```

```bash
git config --global help.autocorrect 20
```

after:

```bash
git statsh pop

WARNING: You called a Git command named 'statsh', witch does not exist.
Continuing in 2.0 seconds, assuming that you meant 'stash'.
```

### Changing push strategies

Using `current` option to push branches with same name.

before:

```bash
git push
fatal: The current branch mko has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin mko
```

configure strategy:

```bash
git config --global push.default current
```

after:

```bash
git push
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To [origin branch]
 * [new branch]      mko -> mko
```

### Enable Git's autosquash feature by default

```bash
git config --global rebase.autosquash true
```
